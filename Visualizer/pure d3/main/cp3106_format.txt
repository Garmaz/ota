PROCESS:
(long, lat, long, lat, dropoff time, pickup time)
Obtain data for 29/4/2015 UTC (~420000 entries)
Sample ~5000 data points
Get time value, scale to 5 min : 0.1 units (0.3 units max delay in our exp)

Obtain proxy of distance from Euclidean distance,
Obtain proxy of duration using dropoff time - pickup time
Calculate average velocity using average distance / average time,
scale such that average velocity is 1 (follows our exp)

Input for visualisation:
1) request dataset:
2) initial agents:
3) assignment: (copy of agent id, request id) 

assignments: { (ordered)
	assignment:
		request: {
			id :
			start:
				x:
				y:
			end:
				x:
				y:
			time: time the request is made
		}
		
		agent: {
			id:
			velocity: 1
			timeavailable: time when the agent finishes it's last request
			lastlocation: the location at wicht the agent as been staying
			start_time: time agent starts moving to req or the time that the agent is assigned to the request( assuming that the agent starts moving the moment it is assigned)
		}

		arrivetime: time agent starts moving to req + distance/(unit velocity)
	}
